Its central theme is the divergence of paths, both literally and figuratively, although its interpretation is noted for being complex and potentially controversial."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"The controversy of the poem's interpretation stems from the fact that the poem is conventionally understood as a testament to individualism, the virtue of self-reliance, and the reward that awaits those who strike out boldly on their own, regardless of common belief and the pull of the crowd. Indeed, the poem often appears in such wishful terms as a feature of corporate sloganeering, trite self-help sentiment, or the wisdom of the aged mentor.

The poem, it might be said, is a poem about lying. "}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"Frost spent the years 1912 to 1915 in England, where among his acquaintances was the writer Edward Thomas. Thomas and Frost became close friends and took many walks together. One day, as they were walking together, they came across two roads. Thomas was indecisive about which road to take, and in retrospect often lamented that they should have taken the other one. After Frost returned to New Hampshire in 1915, he sent Thomas an advance copy of \"The Road Not Taken.\" Frost said he intended the poem as a kind of a joke. Thomas, however, took the poem seriously and personally, and it may have been significant in his decision to enlist in World War I. Thomas was killed two years later in the Battle of Arras."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"The poem consists of four stanzas of five lines each. With the rhyme scheme as ABAAB, the first line rhymes with the third and fourth, and the second line rhymes with the fifth. The meter is iambic tetrameter, with each line having four two-syllable feet, though in almost every line, in different positions, an iamb is replaced with an anapest."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"\"The Road Not Taken\" reads colloquially, beginning as a kind of photographic depiction of a quiet moment in yellow wood. The variation of its rhythm gives naturalness, a feeling of thought occurring spontaneously, affecting the reader's sense of expectation. Lines 9-12, cited above, the few lines containing strictly iambs, the more regular rhythm supports the idea of a turning towards an acceptance of a kind of reality: \"Though as for that the passing there â€¦ \" In the final line, the way the rhyme and rhythm work together is significantly different, and catches the reader off guard."}]},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"text":"In Frost's performance of the poem, recorded almost half a century later, one notes his divergence from the strict formal patterns of the poem--particularly in those lines in which he switches from the high rhetorical oration of the poem's meditative reminiscences to the much more conversational (indeed, almost a whispered aside) in which he confesses that there was, in fact, no real difference between the two roads apparent to the speaker. As the following annotations indicate, Frost's reading of the poem is marked consistently by slow tempo and pronounced caesura, in a recitation that any listener would recognize as a classic version of \"poet voice\" as Marit MacArthur would name it. However, from 00:24 to 00:34, Frost descends into a high tempo, conversational voice as he reveals the truth of the moment.
